# Authentication

## Overview

Folling tasks:

- manage projects
- manage user
- create JWT-Token in case of a login and validate them for each API-access
    - for the token the `jwt-cpp`-library is used
    - only Token-type `HS256` available at the moment
- generating REST-API-Documation
    - request all components for their REST-API-information and converts all these data into one file
    - information for the documentation comes from the `libKitsunemimiSakureLang`-library of each component, which provides the API-endpoints

## Role-system

3 Types of users:

- **Admin**: 
    - can see all resources of all users in all projects
    - can manage (create, delete, ...) users and projects. This is hard defined by the code and can not be changed by the policy-file
    - an Admin-user can not deleted by him/her self, so at least one Admin does every time exist
    - the initial Admin, after a rollout of a new deployment, is created by Hanami
    - Admins have per default the role `admin` and the project-id `admin`
- **Project-Admin**: 
    - role is bonded to a specific project
    - can see all resources of all users within the project, where the Project-Admin-role is bonded to
- **User**
    - default
    - role is bonded to a specific project
    - can only see the own resources within within the project, where the User-role is bonded to

Each resource, which is created (for example a Cluster or Dataset), get the user- and project-id attached, who created the resource. Even users and projects get the id of the admin attached, who created the user or project
