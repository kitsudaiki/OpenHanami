# Code Styling Guide

!!! note

	This is a very basic code styling guide with some hints and restrictions, which have to be followed when contributing code. It is still in a very early stage and will be updated over time.

	Also look into other already existing source-files

	If you seen anything in the code, which doesn't follow this guide here, then please open a Feature-issue with `QA` label.

## General rule

!!! info ""

	Source-Code must be as explicit as possible. Try the keep the amount of used language features as basic as possible. Not every feature has to be used only because it exist. Code, which is hard to understand and to maintain, is the greatest risk factor for stability and security.

## Limitations

### Length of lines

- soft-cap: `100` characters
- hard-cap: `120` characters

### Length of files

- soft-cap: `1000` lines

## Indentation

- 4 whitespaces
- no TAB

## Naming

| localtion | styling | example | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| file-names | snake case | `example_file.cpp` |
| class-names | pascal case | `ExampleClass()` |
| function-names | camel case | `void exampleFunction()` |
| defines | upper case | `#define EXAMPLE_DEFINITION 1` |
| enums | upper case | `UNDEFINED_VAL=1` |

## License

Each source-file need the Apache 2 copy-right header a the beginning. They can be copied of the other files of the same language within the repository.

## Cpp specific structures

### `if`-conditions

`if`-condition must always use the `{}`, even c++ allows to omit them when the content is only one line

!!! example

	```cpp
	if(id == 0) {
		return;
	}
	```

Each condition has to be in a separate line and the binary operator at the beginning of the new line.

!!! example

	```cpp
	if(id == 0
		&& text == "poi"
		&& counter == 42) 
	{
		return;
	}
	```

`if`-condition must never mix `&&`, `||`, ... . `if`-conditions must always be consistent. Using different binary operations within the same condition makes it harder to read and can lead easily to mistakes. If there are different binary operations necessary, then move one type out of the condition into a bool-variable or use a section if-condition.

!!! example

	```cpp
	const bool doesMatch = x == 42 || y == 42;
	if(id == 0
		&& doesMatch) 
	{
		return;
	}
	```

### loops

Same like `if`-conditions they must always use the `{}`, even if the content of the loop contains only one line

!!! example

	```cpp
	for(uint32_t i = 0; i < 42; i++) {
		itemList[i] *= 2;
	}
	```

### `const`

Make as many variables `const` as possible.

### `auto`-type

Code must be as explicit as possible and hiding types behind an `auto`-type makes the code harder to understand for people, who didn't wrote the code. Because of this use the `auto`- as less as possible and ONLY very locally limited. 

For example:

- find values in maps

!!! example

	```cpp
	const auto it = m_valueMap.find(key);
	```

- iteration over maps: 

!!! example

	```cpp
	for(const auto& [id, content] : m_items)
	```

- storing lamda-functions

Hiding primitive types like `int` and so on is not allowed.


### `template`

Same like the `auto`-type. Don't try to use `template` everywhere, because you think it is cool or "modern" cpp programming. Too many templates making the code harder to read and longer to compile. Use them only, when you have good reasons for this decision. 

### `lambda`-functions

Same like for `auto`-type and `template`. Use them only if necessary. If you can solve the same task with a normal function, then use the normal function instead of the `lambda`-function.
