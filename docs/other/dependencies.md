## Overview

The following diagramm shows the basic relations of the library and tools with each other.

I know, this is not a valid UML-diagram or something like this. It should old visualize the relations. A few connections in the diagram doesn't exist at the moment.


| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Hanami** | Core of the Project |
| **Hanami-Dashboard** | Web-Client to directly interact with the Hanami-instance |
| **hanamictl** | CLI-Client to directly interact with the Hanami-instance |
| **SDK_API_Testing** | Functional tests for SDK-library and REST-API | 
| **hanami_sdk** | SDK-library to provide functions for all supported actions to interact with the REST-API and automatic handling of the token-exchange. |
| **hanami_cluster_parser** | Parser-library for cluster-templates |
| **hanami_policies** | Parser for custon policy-files. |
