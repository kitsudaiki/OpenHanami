# CLI-SDK-Docu

The CLI and the SDK-library provides functions to interact with the API of the backend.

!!! info

    If you find any mistakes or mismatches in this documentation, then please create an issue on github, or fix it by yourself and create a pull request on github.

## Installation / Compile

=== "CLI"

    ```bash
    # go into the cli-source-directory
    cd src/cli/hanamictl/

    # build protobuf-messages
    pushd ../sdk/go/hanami_sdk
    protoc --go_out=. --proto_path ../../../libraries/hanami_messages/protobuffers hanami_messages.proto3
    popd

    # build cli-tool
    go build .
    ```

=== "Python-SDK"

    ```bash
    # clone repository
    git clone https://github.com/kitsudaiki/OpenHanami.git

    # create python-env (optional)
    python3 -m venv hanami_sdk_env
    source hanami_sdk_env/bin/activate

    # install sdk
    cd OpenHanami/src/sdk/python/hanami_sdk
    pip3 install -U .
    ```

## Exceptions

Each of the used HTTP-error codes results in a different exception. For the available error-code /
exceptions of each of the endpoints, look into the
[REST-API documenation](https://docs.openhanami.com/api/rest_api_documentation/)

=== "Python-SDK"

    ```python
    from hanami_sdk import hanami_exceptions

    try:
        (command)
    except hanami_exceptions.NotFoundException as e:
        print(e)
    except hanami_exceptions.UnauthorizedException as e:
        print(e)
    except hanami_exceptions.BadRequestException as e:
        print(e)
    except hanami_exceptions.ConflictException as e:
        print(e)
    except hanami_exceptions.InternalServerErrorException as e:
        print("internal error")
    ```

    !!! info

        The `InternalServerErrorException` doesn't contain a message. If this exception appears, you have have to look into the logs on the server.

## For insecure connections

In case the server use self-signed certificates for its https-connection, the ssl verification can
be disabled. Each functions has a paramater `verify_connection`, wich is per default `True`. This
validation can be disabled by adding `,verify_connection=False` to the end of a function-call.

## Request Token

For each of the following actions, the user must request an access-token at the beginning. This
token is a jwt-token with basic information of the user. The token is only valid for a certain
amount of time until it expires, based on the configuration of the server.

=== "CLI"

    In case of the cli, the address and login credentials only have to be set via environment variables

    ```bash
    export HANAMI_ADDRESS=http://127.0.0.1:11418
    export HANAMI_USER=asdf
    export HANAMI_PASSPHRASE=asdfasdf
    ```

=== "Python-SDK"

    ```python
    from hanami_sdk import hanami_token

    address = "http://127.0.0.1:11418"
    test_user = "asdf"
    test_passphrase = "asdfasdf"

    token = hanami_token.request_token(address, test_user, test_passphrase)

    ```

## Project

Non-admin user need to be assigned to a project for logical separation.

!!! info

    These endpoints have a hard-coded requirement, that only admins are allowed to manage projects.

### Create Project

=== "CLI"

    ```bash
    hanamictl project create -n <NAME> <PROJECT_ID>
    ```

    project_name = "Test Project"

    # request a token for a user, who has admin-permissions
    # see: https://docs.openhanami.com/api/sdk_library/#request-token

    result = project.create_project(token, address, projet_id, project_name)

    # example-content of result:

    ```

### Delete User

Delete a user from the backend.

!!! info

    A user can not be deleted by himself.

=== "CLI"

    ```bash
    hanamictl user delete cli_test_user
    ```

    example:

    ```bash
    hanamictl user delete cli_test_user

    successfully deleted project 'cli_test_project'
    ```

=== "Python-SDK"

    ```python
    from hanami_sdk import user

    address = "http://127.0.0.1:11418"
    user_id = "new_user"

    # request a token for a user, who has admin-permissions
    # see: https://docs.openhanami.com/api/sdk_library/#request-token

    user.delete_user(token, address, user_id)
    ```

### Add project to user

Assigne a project to a normal user.

The `role` is uses be the policy-file of the OpenHanami-instance restrict access to specific
API-endpoints. Per default there exist `admin` and `member` as roles.

If `is_project_admin` is set to true, the user can access all resources of all users within the
project.

=== "CLI"

    ```bash
    ```

    example:

    ```bash
    ```

=== "Python-SDK"

    ```python
    from hanami_sdk import user

    address = "http://127.0.0.1:11418"
    user_id = "new_user"
    project_id = "test_project"
    role = "member"
    is_project_admin = True

    # request a token for a user, who has admin-permissions
    # see: https://docs.openhanami.com/api/sdk_library/#request-token

    result = add_roject_to_user(token,
                                address,
                                user_id,
                                project_id,
                                role,
                                is_project_admin)
    ```

### Remove project from user

Unassign a project from a user.

=== "CLI"

    ```bash

    ```

=== "Python-SDK"

    ```python
    from hanami_sdk import user

    address = "http://127.0.0.1:11418"
    user_id = "new_user"

    # request a token for a user, who has admin-permissions
    # see: https://docs.openhanami.com/api/sdk_library/#request-token

    result = remove_project_fromUser(token, address, user_id, project_id)
    ```

### List projects of current user

List projects only of the current user, which are enabled by the current token.

=== "CLI"

    ```bash

    ```

=== "Python-SDK"

    ```python
    from hanami_sdk import user

    address = "http://127.0.0.1:11418"

    # request a token for a user, who has admin-permissions
    # see: https://docs.openhanami.com/api/sdk_library/#request-token

    result = list_projects_of_user(token, address)
    ```

### Switch project-scrope of current user

Switch to another project with the current user.

=== "CLI"

    ```bash

    ```

=== "Python-SDK"

    ```python
    from hanami_sdk import user

    address = "http://127.0.0.1:11418"
    project_id = "test_project"

    # request a token for a user, who has admin-permissions
    # see: https://docs.openhanami.com/api/sdk_library/#request-token

    result = switch_project(token, address, project_id)
    ```

## Data-Set

Datasets are a bunch of train- or test-data, which can be uploaded to the server.

### Upload MNIST-Data-Set

These are files of the official mnist-dataset, which can be uploaded and which are primary used for
testing currently. Each dataset of this type requires the file-path to the local input- and
label-file of the same dataset.

!!! warning

    Because of a lack of validation at the moment, it is easy to break the backend with unexpected input.

=== "CLI"

    ```bash
    hanamictl dataset create mnist -i <PATH_TO_INPUT_FILE> -l <PATH_TO_LABEL_FILE> <NAME>
    ```

    example:

    ```bash
    hanamictl dataset create mnist -i /tmp/train-images-idx3-ubyte -l /tmp/train-labels-idx1-ubyte cli_test_dataset

    # }
    ```

### Delete Data-Set

Delete a dataset.

=== "CLI"

    ```bash
    hanamictl dataset delete <DATASET_UUID>
    ```

    example:

    ```bash
    hanamictl dataset delete 146bacb3-b5bf-485b-a2e8-d1812b57eb63

    successfully deleted dataset '146bacb3-b5bf-485b-a2e8-d1812b57eb63'
    ```

=== "Python-SDK"

    ```python
    from hanami_sdk import dataset

    address = "http://127.0.0.1:11418"
    dataset_uuid = "6f2bbcd2-7081-4b08-ae1d-16e6cd6f54c4"

    # request a token for a user, who has admin-permissions
    # see: https://docs.openhanami.com/api/sdk_library/#request-token

    dataset.delete_dataset(token, address, dataset_uuid)
    ```

### Check MNIST Dataset Result

Checks a resulting dataset from an MNIST-test against a reference-dataset to compare how much of the
output of the network was correct. The output gives the percentage of the correct output-values. It
is primary used for automatic testing.

=== "CLI"

    ```bash
    hanamictl dataset check -r <REFERENCE_DATASET_UUID> <COMPARE_DATASET_UUID>
    ```

    example:

    ```bash
    hanamictl dataset check -r 6f2bbcd2-7081-4b08-ae1d-16e6cd6f54c4 d40c0c06-bd28-49a4-b872-6a70c4750bb9

    +----------+-------------------+
    | ACCURACY | 91.22999572753906 |
    +----------+-------------------+
    ```

=== "Python-SDK"

    ```python
    from hanami_sdk import request_result

    address = "http://127.0.0.1:11418"
    reference_dataset_uuid = "c7f7e274-5d7d-4696-8591-18441cb1b685"
    dataset_uuid = "d40c0c06-bd28-49a4-b872-6a70c4750bb9"

    # request a token for a user, who has admin-permissions
    # see: https://docs.openhanami.com/api/sdk_library/#request-token

    result = request_result.check_mnist_dataset(token,
                                                address,
                                                dataset_uuid,
                                                reference_dataset_uuid)

    # example-content of result:
    #
    # {
    #     "accuracy": 93.40999603271484
    # }
    ```

### Download Dataset content

At the moment it is not possible to download complete datasets via websocket, like it is done for
the upload. For now there is only an endpoint to request a slice of a dataset.

=== "CLI"

    ```bash
    hanamictl dataset content -c <COLUMN_NAME>  -n <NUMBER_OF_ROWS> -o <ROW_OFFSET>  <DATASET_UUID>
    ```

    example:

    ```bash
    hanamictl dataset content -c test_output -o 100 -n 10 718566ed-b8a7-4d69-8cf5-d3eb7d75e30b

## Cluster

Cluster containing the neural network.

### Create Cluster

To initialize a new cluster, a cluster-templated is used, which describes the basic structure of the
network (see documentation of the
[cluster-templates](https://docs.openhanami.com/api/cluster_template/))

=== "CLI"

    ```bash
    hanamictl cluster create -t <PATH_TO_TEMPLATE> <NAME>
    ```

    example:

    ```bash
    hanamictl cluster create -t ./cluster_template cli_test_cluster

### Get Cluster

Get information of a specific cluster.

!!! info It is basically the same output like coming from the create command and contains only the
data stored in the database. Information about the cluster itself, like number of neurons, amount of
used memory and so on are still missing in this output currently.

=== "CLI"

    ```bash
    hanamictl cluster get <CLUSTER_UUID>
    ```

    example:

    ```bash
    hanamictl cluster get 12959485-51a7-45bc-84dd-aad1c9bfd510

    cluster.delete_cluster(token, address, cluster_uuid)
    ```

### Create Checkpoint of Cluster

Save the state of the cluster by creating a checkpoint, which is stored on the server.

=== "CLI"

    ```bash
    hanamictl cluster save -n <NAME> <CLUSTER_UUID>
    ```

    example:

    ```bash
    hanamictl cluster save -n cli_test_checkpoint d28d72f0-f95f-42bd-b14d-b7e12d3b9d82

    +------------+--------------------------------------+
    | UUID       | d28d72f0-f95f-42bd-b14d-b7e12d3b9d82 |
    | NAME       | cli_test_checkpoint                  |
    +------------+--------------------------------------+
    ```

=== "Python-SDK"

    ```python
    from hanami_sdk import cluster

    address = "http://127.0.0.1:11418"
    checkpoint_name = "test_checkpoint"

    # request a token for a user, who has admin-permissions
    # see: https://docs.openhanami.com/api/sdk_library/#request-token

    result = cluster.save_cluster(token, address, checkpoint_name, cluster_uuid)

    # example-content of result:
    #
    # {
    #     "name": "test_checkpoint",
    #     "uuid": "d7130869-520f-4743-8f90-4f17f3382321"
    # }
    ```

### Restore Checkpoint of Cluster

Reset a cluster to the state, which is stored in a specific checkpoint.

=== "CLI"

    ```bash
    hanamictl cluster restore -c <CHECKPOINT_UUID> <CLUSTER_UUID>
    ```

    example:

    ```bash
    hanamictl cluster restore -c d28d72f0-f95f-42bd-b14d-b7e12d3b9d82 cc6120c7-cc31-4f17-baee-c6c606f00512

    +------------+--------------------------------------+
    | UUID       | 6e7a911e-5f81-4ffb-9de0-2b6717b1be52 |
    +------------+--------------------------------------+
    ```

=== "Python-SDK"

    ```python
    from hanami_sdk import cluster

    address = "http://127.0.0.1:11418"
    checkpoint_uuid = "cc6120c7-cc31-4f17-baee-c6c606f00512"
    cluster_uuid = "d94f2b53-f404-4215-9a33-63c4a03e3202"

    # request a token for a user, who has admin-permissions
    # see: https://docs.openhanami.com/api/sdk_library/#request-token

    result = cluster.restore_cluster(token, address, checkpoint_uuid, cluster_uuid)

    # example-content of result:
    #
    # {
    #     "uuid": "e27e4834-64df-4db2-883e-9bfb44bc6753"
    # }
    ```

### Switch Host

Each CPU and GPU is handled as its logical host. Cluster and be moved between them. To list
avaialble hosts there is the
[list-hosts endpoint](https://docs.openhanami.com/api/sdk_library/#list-hosts).

!!! warning

    GPU-support is not available at the moment and multi CPU is also still not supported, so this function is basically not avaiable in the current state

=== "CLI"

    (Not implemented by the CLI)

=== "Python-SDK"

    ```python
    from hanami_sdk import cluster

    address = "http://127.0.0.1:11418"
    host_uuid = "cc6120c7-cc31-4f17-baee-c6c606f00512"
    cluster_uuid = "d94f2b53-f404-4215-9a33-63c4a03e3202"

    # request a token for a user, who has admin-permissions
    # see: https://docs.openhanami.com/api/sdk_library/#request-token

    result = cluster.switch_host(token, address, cluster_uuid, host_uuid)

    # example-content of result:
    #
    # {
    #     "name": "test_cluster",
    #     "owner_id": "asdf",
    #     "project_id": "admin",
    #     "uuid": "d94f2b53-f404-4215-9a33-63c4a03e3202",
    #     "visibility": "private"
    # }
    ```

## Task

Tasks are asynchronous actions, which are placed within a queue of the cluster, which should be
affected by the task. They are processed one after another.

### Create Train-Task

Create a new task to train the cluster with the data of a dataset, which was uploaded before.

=== "CLI"

    ```bash
    hanamictl task create train -j \
    -i <INPUT_DATASET_UUID>:<INPUT_DATASET_COLUMN_NAME>:<INPUT_HEXAGON_NAME> \
    -o <LABEL_DATASET_UUID>:<LABEL_DATASET_COLUMN_NAME>:<LABEL_HEXAGON_NAME> \
    -c <CLUSTER_UUID> \
    <TASK_NAME>
    ```

    example:

    ```bash
    hanamictl task create train -j \
    -i b03d1682-8f5b-48cb-bff5-08b67e8de6fe:picture:picture_hexagon \
    -o b833ddbe-55db-49d5-97b7-771293505493:label:label_hexagon \

### Delete Task

Delete a task from a cluster. In this task was a request and produced a request-result, this result
will not be deleted.

=== "CLI"

    ```bash
    hanamictl task delete -c <CLUSTER_UUID> <TASK_UUID>
    ```

    example:

    ```bash
    hanamictl task delete -c 49d50999-c47f-48cb-906b-211218f897e4 ddbf5bc1-3487-4755-8651-a96842ccec12

    successfully deleted task 'ddbf5bc1-3487-4755-8651-a96842ccec12'
    ```

=== "Python-SDK"

    ```python
    from hanami_sdk import task

    address = "http://127.0.0.1:11418"
    cluster_uuid = "9f86921d-9a7c-44a2-836c-1683928d9354"
    task_uuid = "c7f7e274-5d7d-4696-8591-18441cb1b685"

    # request a token for a user, who has admin-permissions
    # see: https://docs.openhanami.com/api/sdk_library/#request-token

    task.delete_task(token, address, task_uuid, cluster_uuid)
    ```

## Direct-IO

It is possible to directly connect via websocket to the cluster on the server to make single
requests much faster, because it doesn't use the REST-API. It is an alternative to the tasks.

!!! info

    To avoid conflicts, the activation of these direct interaction requires an empty task-queue of the related cluster.

!!! warning

    The websocket-connection is not bound to the expire-time of the token.

### direct train

        exprected_values = [1.0, 0.0]

        # request a token for a user, who has admin-permissions
        # see: https://docs.openhanami.com/api/sdk_library/#request-token

        # initial request of a websocket connection to a specific cluster
        # this websocket can be used for multiple request
        ws = await cluster.switch_to_direct_mode(token, address, cluster_uuid)

        # names "test_input" and "test_output" are the names of the hexagons within the cluster
        # for the mapping of the input-data
        # if the last argument is set to "True", it says that there are no more data to
        # apply to the cluster and that the train-process can start

        await direct_io.send_train_input(ws, "test_output", exprected_values, True)

        await ws.close()

        cluster.switch_to_task_mode(token, address, cluster_uuid)

## Checkpoint

Checkpoints are a copy of the current state of a cluster. It can be used as backup to restore an
older state a cluster.

!!! info

    It is possible to apply a checkpoint to any cluster, but at the moment it is not possible to directly create a new cluster out of a checkpoint.

### List Checkpoints

List all visible checkpoints.

=== "CLI"

    ```bash
    hanamictl checkpoint list
    ```

    example:

    ```bash
    hanamictl checkpoint list

    +--------------------------------------+---------------------+------------+----------+------------+---------------------+
    |                 UUID                 |        NAME         | VISIBILITY | OWNER ID | PROJECT ID |     CREATED AT      |
    +--------------------------------------+---------------------+------------+----------+------------+---------------------+
    | 9303816f-e575-410b-a75d-8444ff3ac303 | cli_test_checkpoint | private    | asdf     | admin      | 2024-07-12 20:46:50 |
    +--------------------------------------+---------------------+------------+----------+------------+---------------------+
    ```

=== "Python-SDK"

    ```python
    from hanami_sdk import checkpoint

    address = "http://127.0.0.1:11418"

    # request a token for a user, who has admin-permissions
    # see: https://docs.openhanami.com/api/sdk_library/#request-token

    result = checkpoint.list_checkpoints(token, address)

    # example-content of result:
    #
    # {
    #     "body": [
    #         [
    #             "cc6120c7-cc31-4f17-baee-c6c606f00512",
    #             "admin",
    #             "asdf",
    #             "private",
    #             "test_checkpoint"
    #         ]

    #         "visibility",
    #         "name"
    #     ]
    # }
    ```

### Delete Checkpoint

Delete a checkpoint from the backend.

=== "CLI"

    ```bash
    hanamictl checkpoint delete <CHECKPOINT_UUID>
    ```

    example:

    ```bash
    hanamictl checkpoint delete 84eaae8e-aeae-4db4-840e-ca38f4461ec7

    successfully deleted checkpoint '84eaae8e-aeae-4db4-840e-ca38f4461ec7'
    ```

=== "Python-SDK"

    ```python
    from hanami_sdk import checkpoint

    address = "http://127.0.0.1:11418"
    checkpoint_uuid = "cc6120c7-cc31-4f17-baee-c6c606f00512"

    # request a token for a user, who has admin-permissions
    # see: https://docs.openhanami.com/api/sdk_library/#request-token

    checkpoint.delete_checkpoint(token, address, checkpoint_uuid)

    ```

## Hosts

### List Hosts

Each CPU and GPU is handled as its own logical host to have more control over the exact location of
the data. These logical hosts can be listed with this endpoint.

=== "CLI"

    ```bash
    hanamictl host list
    ```

    example:

    ```bash
    hanamictl host list

    +--------------------------------------+------+
    |                 UUID                 | TYPE |
