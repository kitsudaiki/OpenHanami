# SDK-library

The SDK-library privides functions to interact with the API of the backend. At the moment 2 versions are provided:

- `Python`
- (`Go`)
- (`Javascript`)

!!! info

    This documentation is not automatically generated from the source-code. So if you find outdated or broken function in this documentation, then please create an issue on github or fix this by yourself and create a pull-request.

## Installation


=== "Python"

    ```bash
    # clone repository
    git clone https://github.com/kitsudaiki/Hanami.git

    # create python-env (optional)
    python3 -m venv hanami_sdk_env
    source hanami_sdk_env/bin/activate

    # install sdk
    cd Hanami/src/sdk/python/hanami_sdk
    pip3 install -U .
    ```

## Exceptions

Each of the used HTTP-error codes results in a different exception. For the available error-code / exceptions of each of the endpoints, look into the [REST-API documenation](https://docs.hanami-ai.com/api/rest_api_documentation/)

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from hanami_sdk import hanami_exceptions

    try:
        (command)
    except hanami_exceptions.NotFoundException as e:
        print(e)
    except hanami_exceptions.UnauthorizedException as e:
        print(e)
    except hanami_exceptions.BadRequestException as e:
        print(e)
    except hanami_exceptions.ConflictException as e:
        print(e)
    except hanami_exceptions.InternalServerErrorException as e:
        print("internal error")
    ```

    !!! info

        The `InternalServerErrorException` doesn't contain a message. If this exception appears, you have have to look into the logs on the server.

## For insecure connections

In case the server use self-signed certificates for its https-connection, the ssl verification can be disabled. Each functions has a paramater `verify_connection`, wich is per default `True`. This validation can be disabled by adding `,verify_connection=False` to the end of a function-call.

## Request Token

For each of the following actions, the user must request an access-token at the beginning. This token is a jwt-token with basic information of the user. The token is only valid for a certain amount of time until it expires, based on the configuration of the server.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from hanami_sdk import hanami_token

    address = "http://127.0.0.1:11418"
    test_user = "asdf"
    test_pw = "asdfasdf"

    token = hanami_token.request_token(address, test_user, test_pw)

    ```

## Data-Set

Datasets are a bunch of train- or test-data, which can be uploaded to the server.

### Upload MNIST-Data-Set

These are files of the official mnist-dataset, which can be uploaded and which are primary used for testing currently. Each dataset of this type requires the file-path to the local input- and label-file of the same dataset. 

!!! warning

    Because of a lack of validation at the moment, it is easy to break the backend with unexpected input.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from hanami_sdk import dataset

    address = "http://127.0.0.1:11418"
    train_dataset_name = "train_test_dataset"
    train_inputs = "/tmp/mnist/train-images.idx3-ubyte"

        "version: 1\n" \
        "bricks:\n" \
        "    1,1,1\n" \
        "        input: test_input\n" \
        "        number_of_neurons: 784\n" \
        "    2,1,1\n" \
        "        number_of_neurons: 400\n" \

    # }
    ```


### Get Cluster

Get information of a specific cluster. 

!!! info
    It is basically the same output like coming from the create command and contains only the data stored in the database. Information about the cluster itself, like number of neurons, amount of used memory and so on are still missing in this output currently.

### Switch Host

Each CPU and GPU is handled as its logical host. Cluster and be moved between them. To list avaialble hosts there is the [list-hosts endpoint](https://docs.hanami-ai.com/api/sdk_library/#list-hosts).

!!! warning

    Only supported for 1 cpu currently. Support for NUMA-architecture comes in the future. Multiple gpu's are theoretically supported, but this case was not tested currently.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from hanami_sdk import cluster

    address = "http://127.0.0.1:11418"
    host_uuid = "cc6120c7-cc31-4f17-baee-c6c606f00512"
    cluster_uuid = "d94f2b53-f404-4215-9a33-63c4a03e3202"

    # request a token for a user, who has admin-permissions
    # see: https://docs.hanami-ai.com/api/sdk_library/#request-token

    result = cluster.switch_host(token, address, cluster_uuid, host_uuid)

    # example-content of result:
    #
    # {
    #     "name": "test_cluster",
    #     "owner_id": "asdf",
    #     "project_id": "admin",
    #     "uuid": "d94f2b53-f404-4215-9a33-63c4a03e3202",
    #     "visibility": "private"
    # }
    ```

## Task

Tasks are asynchronous actions, which are placed within a queue of the cluster, which should be affected by the task. They are processed one after another. 

### Create Train-Task

Create a new task to train the cluster with the data of a dataset, which was uploaded before.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from hanami_sdk import task

    address = "http://127.0.0.1:11418"
    task_name = "test_task"
    cluster_uuid = "9f86921d-9a7c-44a2-836c-1683928d9354"
    inputs = {
        "picture": "6f2bbcd2-7081-4b08-ae1d-16e6cd6f54c4"
    }
    outputs = {
        "label": "6f2bbcd2-7081-4b08-ae1d-16e6cd6f54c4"
    }

    # inputs and outputs are maps with key-value-pairs, 
    # where the key is the name of the brick of the matching 
    # field within the dataset and the value is the UUID of 
    # the used dataset for the input- and output-data

    # request a token for a user, who has admin-permissions
    # see: https://docs.hanami-ai.com/api/sdk_library/#request-token

    result = task.create_train_task(token, 
                                    address, 
                                    task_name, 
                                    cluster_uuid, 
                                    inputs,
                                    outputs)
    task_uuid = json.loads(result)["uuid"]

    # optional you can wait until the task is finished
    finished = False
    while not finished:
        result = task.get_task(token, address, task_uuid, cluster_uuid)
        finished = json.loads(result)["state"] == "finished"
        print("wait for finish task")
        time.sleep(1)
    ```

### Create Request-Task

Create a new task to request information from a trained cluster. As input the data of a dataset are used, which had to be uplaoded first. The output is written into a [request-result](https://docs.hanami-ai.com/api/sdk_library/#request-result). This output has the same UUID and name, like the original task.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from hanami_sdk import task

    address = "http://127.0.0.1:11418"
    task_name = "test_task"
    cluster_uuid = "9f86921d-9a7c-44a2-836c-1683928d9354"
    inputs = {
        "picture": "6f2bbcd2-7081-4b08-ae1d-16e6cd6f54c4"
    }

    results = {
        "label": "test_output"
    }

    # inputs and results are maps with key-value-pairs, 
    # where the key is the name of the brick of the matching 
    # field within the dataset and the value is the UUID of 
    # the used dataset for the input- and output-data

    # request a token for a user, who has admin-permissions
    # see: https://docs.hanami-ai.com/api/sdk_library/#request-token

    result = task.create_request_task(token, 
                                      address, 
                                      task_name, 
                                      cluster_uuid, 
                                      inputs,
                                      results)
    task_uuid = json.loads(result)["uuid"]

    # optional you can wait until the task is finished
    finished = False
    while not finished:
        result = task.get_task(token, address, task_uuid, cluster_uuid)
        finished = json.loads(result)["state"] == "finished"
        print("wait for finish task")
        time.sleep(1)
    ```

### Get Task

=== "Python"

    #     "start_timestamp": "2024-01-08 21:19:16",
    #     "state": "active"
    # }
    ```

### List Task

List all tasks for a cluster, together with their progress.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from hanami_sdk import task

    address = "http://127.0.0.1:11418"

    #         "end"
    #     ]
    # }
    ```


### Delete Task

Delete a task from a cluster. In this task was a request and produced a request-result, this result will not be deleted.

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from hanami_sdk import task

    address = "http://127.0.0.1:11418"
    cluster_uuid = "9f86921d-9a7c-44a2-836c-1683928d9354"
    task_uuid = "c7f7e274-5d7d-4696-8591-18441cb1b685"

    # request a token for a user, who has admin-permissions
    # see: https://docs.hanami-ai.com/api/sdk_library/#request-token

    task.delete_task(token, address, task_uuid, cluster_uuid)
    ```


## Direct-IO

It is possible to directly connect via websocket to the cluster on the server to make single requests much faster, because it doesn't use the REST-API. It is an alternative to the tasks. 

!!! info

    To avoid conflicts, the activation of these direct interaction requires an empty task-queue of the related cluster.

!!! warning

    The websocket-connection is not bound to the expire-time of the token.

### direct train
