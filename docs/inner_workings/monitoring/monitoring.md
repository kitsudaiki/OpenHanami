# Monitoring

Their are 4 major tasks to do:

1.  optimize the usage of the hardware by supporting CPU-scheduling of all threads of all components

2.  read and observe system-information of CPU

    !!! info

        Observation of memory, GPU, network and storage comes later.

3.  Change CPU-frequency based on the workload

    !!! warning

        Disabled at the moment because of less priority

4.  measure Power-consumption, thermal output and frequency of the CPU

    !!! info

        Power-consumption works only on Intel-cpus currently and only when the program runs as root.

<!-- ## **Collecting information**

For collecting of hardware-information the library `libKitsunemimiSakuraHardware` is used and interact with other specific libraries in order to get all information of the hardware.

![Workflow-component](Azuki_hardware_layer.drawio)

At the moment only CPU related information are collected. The collected data are hold in the data-structure for easier access. In this structure it is easier to identify for example, which two CPU-threads are sharing the same physical CPU-core.

## **Thread-Binding**

The only energy-optimization, at least for now, is thread-binding.

Each thread, which is created with the thread-class of the library `hanami_common`, has a name
attached. With this name the thread is accessible over the singleton thread-manager-class and can be
accessed from anywhere in the code. Additionally the thread-class possess the ability to bind the
thread to one or more CPU-threads to enforce the location on the CPU, where the thread should be
executed.

![Workflow-component](Azuki_internal.drawio)

In the current version this is quite static and simple. Each worker-thread of hanami, which process
the neural network, runs on the CPU-cores >1 and every other thread is executed on the first
physical CPU-core. It also identifies in case of hyperthreading, which cpu-threads are sharing the
same physical core and consider this, when binding the threads. By enforcing that the 2 threads of
the same physical CPU-core are used, instead of 2 threads on two different cores, it can save much
energy.

## **Controlling CPU frequency**

!!! warning

    Disabled at the moment because of less priority

Hanami can change the frequency of the CPU. It was tested in an earlier state and the result looked
like this:

Every spike in the graph means, that a task comes to be processed. Between the task, the cpu is
enforced to minimal cpu-frequency and so also minimal power consumption.
