# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### BREAKING-CHANGES

#### API-Breaking

- the input definition for the tasks was changes to removed the naming restriction between dataset-column and hexagon-name
- the external REST-API endpoint to validate a token was removed and replaced by an internal function, which is used instead for all incoming api-requests

## v0.4.0

**Release-Date**: 2024-01-21

### BREAKING-CHANGES

#### Checkpoint-Breaking

- Complete restructure of the core to improve the performance of the CUDA-kernel by enabling more capabilities for parallel processing.
- Synapse-blocks are not limited to a single cluster-scoped buffer, but instead are stored in a global buffer, which is shared by multiple cluster.
- The number of used synapse-blocks is now independed from the number of neuron-blocks of a brick. They scale now better over time. This way the number of neurons in the clsuter-template are only a maximum value. This way it is easier to too high values in the cluster-template are no pain-point anymore.

#### API-Breaking

- removed c++ version of the SDK

### Added

- multi-threading, so now multiple cpu-threads can process the same cluster at the same time
- new endpoint to list logical hosts (cpu's and gpu's)
- new endpoint to move a cluster between cpu and gpu
- re-added the spiking neural network-feature for future testing-purpose
- re-added a connection-distance of more the one for future testing-purpose
- python version of the SDK
- basic cli-client in go 
- new entry in config to define a location for temporary files while uploading
- new cleanup-loop for tempfiles, which deleted incative temporary files after a certain amount of time, to remove file of a broken upload-process
- the reduction-process was re-added to limit the amount of used memory while learning.

### Changed

- physical host is now separated into logical hosts (a cpu and a gpu are handled as 2 different logical hosts)
- replaced old api-test-tool by a new python-script, which use and test the new python version of the SDK
- moved from `qmake` to `cmake` as build-tool for the c++ code

### Removed

- removed GET-requests from audit-log
- removed c++ version of the SDK

## v0.3.0 

**Release-Date**: 2023-09-05

### BREAKING-CHANGES

#### All breaking

- Move the entire project from a micro-service architecture to a more monolithic architecture with only one executable but still multiple libraries, to reduce unnecessary complexity and increase performance and reliability of the program. Also it makes the developing process easier and faster, with is necessary in regard of my limited time-resources.
- Removed entire segment-layer between the clusters and bricks from core structure. This layer was originally intended for the separation of multiple threads, but now there is another strategy planed 

#### API-Breaking

- REST-API endpoint for the generation of the documentation was removed
- Renamed `snapshot` to `checkpoint` and `learn` to `train`

#### Database-Breaking

- fixed sizes of some database-columns for user- and project-id's

#### Checkpoint-Breaking

- Bigger rework of the core structs to get rid of the update-positions struct

### Added

- documentation of config-entries and database-schemas can now also be generated as marddown-documents
- error-codes are now also written into the REST-API documentation
- new config-entry to enable the extremely experimental CUDA-processing
- more then one thread is now created for the core-processing, to be able to process multiple clusters in parallel
- the CUDA-version now also works with Checkpoints (create and read)

### Changed

- Rename repository/project from `Hanami-AI` to `Hanami`
- Renamed libraries to `hanami_...` and namespaces of the libraries to `Hanami`, because the originally naming and structure was from the time, when they were separate repositores and desired also for other projects. The new naming makes the names shorter and easier.
- replace custom jwt lib by `jwt-cpp` (https://github.com/Thalhammer/jwt-cpp)
- REST-API documentation is now generated as OpenAPI-specification and added to the documentation via swagger-ui
- merged networking-libraries in context of the renaming
- config-handler was internally restructured for the new generator of the config-documentation
- registration of fields in API-endpoints was updated for cleaner code
- Button in dashboard for the geneartion of the Documentation was removed and is now done by a new CLI flag.
- merged entire code into one single docker-image
- better segmentation of the synapses

### Fixed

- solved all compiler-warnings (disabled libraries not included)
- fixed stupid memory leaks in API and task-handling
- fixed handling in database-requests to separate correctly between an internal-error and a not-found to give the correct HTTP response to the user
- after a restart of the backend, all clusters are not removed from database at the start to avoid broken clusters, because cluster are in-memory and don't survive a restart
- positioning of header-texts in dashboard was fixed

### Removed

- Removed OpenCL-kernel for the moment. The CUDA-variant is enough for testing and easier to update.



## v0.2.0 

**Release-Date**: 2023-03-15

### Breaking-Changes

#### API-Breaking

- use now custom syntax for cluster- and segment-templates instead of json
- use protobuf-messages to send payload of files
- merge endpoints to create train- and request-tasks for csv- and mnist-files into one endpoint
- creating a task doesn't require the explicit selecting of the data-set type. This is now read from the data-set metadata

#### Checkpoint-Breaking

- changed internal data-structure of the core in order to make GPU-support possible without race-conditions

### Changed

- **merged all repositories (source-code, documentation, build, deploy) into this main-repository here**
- made token-key and registry in helm-chart configurable
- made token expire-time configurable in Misaki
- core-internal renamings of structs and functions
- use dropdown-menu instead of single buttons in table-entries within the dashboard
- use nested namespaces in sakura- and hanami-layer
- changed a huge amount of map-iterators to c++17 style

### Added 

- Added experimental GPU-support with CUDA and OpenCL (per default hard in source-code disbabled at the moment)
- internal tokens requestable form Misaki
- API-endpoints and database-table to request logs with page-selector
- print audit-logs in dashboard

### Fixed

- fix random breaks of the websocket under high load in the Torii
- fixed memory-corruption in segment-header of the clusters in Kyouko
